# REST UI
> REST UI is "Work in Progress"

REST UI is a simple application to test REST Clients. With REST UI you can create mocked REST APIs and easily review the incoming requests.

## Technology & Architecture
This little project is an experiment of a new UI architectural style I never worked with before.
It uses something like a mix of Redux/Flux and MVVM.

// TODO More Info here...

## Known Issues
- **Application does not exit correctly:** This is a problem most likely due to an async server stop during application shutdown.
- **Docs:** KDoc is improvable.
